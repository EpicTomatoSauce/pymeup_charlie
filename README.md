This repository contains the coursework submission for PyMeUpCharlie and for the following tasks:

1) PyBank:
    Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:
    The total number of months included in the dataset
    The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
    The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
    The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

2) PyPoll:
    The total number of votes cast
    A complete list of candidates who received votes
    The percentage of votes each candidate won
    The total number of votes each candidate won
    The winner of the election based on popular vote.

3) PyBoss:
In this challenge, you get to be the boss. You oversee hundreds of employees across the country developing Tuna 2.0, a world-changing snack food based on canned tuna fish. Alas, being the boss isn't all fun, games, and self-adulation. The company recently decided to purchase a new HR system, and unfortunately for you, the new system requires employee records be stored completely differently.
Your task is to help bridge the gap by creating a Python script able to convert your employee records to the required format. Your script will need to do the following:
    The Name column should be split into separate First Name and Last Name columns.
    The DOB data should be re-written into MM/DD/YYYY format.
    The SSN data should be re-written such that the first five numbers are hidden from view.
    The State data should be re-written as simple two-letter abbreviations. -->
